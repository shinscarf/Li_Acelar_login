     <p>It has been observed around our school, homes, and workplaces, that even if there are policies being implemented for the sake of mother nature, there are still instances and events wherein care for the environment is still not being shown. It may be for the reasons that people are in a hurry, have either willingly or truly forgotten about their trash, or have the lack of knowledge as to the effects of littering. Other people may have also experienced throwing the trash in the proper place to be a tedious thing to do as it still requires a bit of extra thinking as to which trash bin the waste belongs to. </p> 
    <p>Despite these taking place, there is still a need to remember and be aware of the harmful effects of disregarding our trash. These events and instances that harm our environment must be resolved- before it is too late. According to ecoschools.global, litter can be harmful to people, animals and the natural environment, as it can threaten their existence and evolution. The major impacts involve the danger to public health, the risk of fire hazards, endangering, or even killing wildlife, and the serious damage to waterways. </p>
    <p> In addition to this, as a result of irresponsible pollution, protecting the environment may now require some extra resources, of which the time and effort being used to do this, could have been spent to preserve the environment. </p>
    <p>The importance of care for the environment and the reduction of trash must be treated seriously wherever we may be. Everyone must have the initiative to be alert towards instances where others may have forgotten the importance of reducing waste and putting them in the proper place. This will be for the better of our planet earth, and for the world of the future generations to come. </p> </div>

     <h3>PLANS/ PROJECTS FOR THE ADVOCACY</h3>
     <p>This advocacy aims to accomplish the “Let’SavEarth” project set within the next years, in order to promote the awareness and host activities in different venues in order to show more care for the environment. </p>
     <p>In lieu with this, some activities include the collection of trash by the sea, within the vicinity of parks, playgrounds, buildings, and sidewalks to lessen the amount of waste that are in spots where they do not belong in. This project welcomes anyone to sign up and join for free and invites every interested person to enlist and participate. </p> </div>
